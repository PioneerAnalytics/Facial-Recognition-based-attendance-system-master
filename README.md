# Facial-Recognition-based-attendance-system
In this project we proposed to make a facial recognition based attendance system using Python and Open CV.
It is a team project in which we have used python libraries such as tkinter,open-cv and numpy.
Few pretrained models such as haarcascade classifier and lbph are also used.
Python sql-connector library is used to integrate database.
